# Vigilant Canine
Simple Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed for average users.

# Introduction

There are several enterprise-grade Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) currently available (e.g., OSSEC 
and Wahzu). This project does not compete with these products nor does it target their users. Instead, this project 
intends to provide a very simple to use, low resource, and completely opensource solution for home users (or maybe 
small offices). The goal is so simple that a Linux/BSD distribution could automatically ship this software enabled 
to provide additional security.

# Goals

- Super simple to install, configure, understand, and use.
- Low resources.
- Meant for average users (e.g., inexperienced Linux user or experienced user who just needs to protect a few 
  systems).
- Could be shipped enabled by distributions.
